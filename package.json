  "description": "For a while now APEX has had a `Maximum Session Idle Time in Seconds` attribute in the Security Settings of an application. As one might imagine, this setting allows developers to kill a userâ€™s session if the user has been idle for a certain amount of time. The problem, however, is that the implementation of this feature is purely server side (which is good from a security perspective).",
